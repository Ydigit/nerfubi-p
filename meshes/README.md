# Meshes Documentation

This directory contains the 3D mesh files used for comparing the three NeRF models in this project. Each mesh represents the output of a specific NeRF model and is intended for interactive visualization.

## Mesh Files

- **Model1_Mesh.obj**: This mesh is generated from the first NeRF model. It showcases the capabilities of the model in rendering detailed structures.
- **Model2_Mesh.obj**: This mesh is generated from the second NeRF model. It highlights improvements in texture and detail compared to the first model.
- **Model3_Mesh.obj**: This mesh is generated from the third NeRF model. It demonstrates the latest advancements in rendering techniques and performance.

## Usage

To view the meshes interactively, ensure you have the necessary viewer integrated into the website. The meshes can be loaded and manipulated to compare the differences in rendering quality and detail across the models.

## Sources

The meshes are derived from the outputs of the respective NeRF models trained on specific datasets. For more information on the datasets and training processes, refer to the main project documentation.
